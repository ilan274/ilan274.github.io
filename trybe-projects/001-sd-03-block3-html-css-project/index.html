        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises
          vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/keyboardist Joe
          Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester
          Bennington
          and bassist Kyle Christner are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park has
          experimented with their music throughout their career by incorporating heavy metal, hard rock, hip hop, pop,
          and
          electronica.

          Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000),
          which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] Their second album,
          Meteora (2003), continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200, and was followed by extensive touring
          and charity work. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in their
          first two albums, the band explored other genres on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007), which also
          topped the Billboard 200.

        <h2>1996-2000: Early years</h2>
        <p>Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three
          attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high
          school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix"
          Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band
          began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a
          four-track
          demo tape, entitled Xero. Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after they failed to land a
          record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's
          vocalist,
          to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and
          ska band.</p>
