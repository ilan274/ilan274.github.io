/* Write a program that is named after a chess piece and returns the movements it makes.
As a challenge, make the program work both if you receive the name of a piece with uppercase letters and with lowercase letters; without increasing the number of conditionals.
As a tip, you can search for a function that makes a string have all lower case letters.
If the part passed is invalid, the program should return an error message.
Example: bishop -> diagonals */
