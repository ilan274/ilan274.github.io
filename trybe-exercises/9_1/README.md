Instructions for performing the exercises

In the following exercises, you will work with a data structure representing a list of books, containing information such as the name of the book, genre, the person who authored the book and release date. In each exercise, you will be asked to find or produce some information about this list using the functions you learned today.
All exercises contain a base code. You must copy this code and save it in a file named after the exercise number, completing the blank function. For example, exercise 1 must be saved in the file exercise1.js, and so on.
In each exercise, there are one or more function calls from the assert module. These functions will automatically check if your code returns the expected result. Your solution will only be considered correct if all the asserts in the file are executed without errors.
