**To practice the concepts of today's class you will animate playing cards! Given the downloadable card images on this link, place the cards side by side in rows of up to 7 cards.**

**The requirements are as follows:**
1. The face-down card must be above the “card grid” and a click on it must make a card appear on the grid. This card represents your deck.
2. The grid consists of 7 cards on each line, with as many lines as the user wants. The images of the cards can be repeated.
3. The card to emerge is a random image of the given card set.
4. Each card must be animated when the mouse is over it.
5. Each card must have animation and the animation for each card must be set randomly.
6. All animation must end with the card in its initial state.
7. The possible animations for the cards are:
8. The card rotates horizontally, like the propeller of an airplane.
9. The card must increase and decrease, as if it were "coming up".
