1) After 1 second of loading the page, make the green ball go from the left edge to the right edge over 3 seconds.

2) After 2 seconds of loading the page, make the green ball go from the left edge to the right edge for 2 seconds. At the end of the animation, the ball must remain on the right edge. Use the keyframe created for exercise number 1 for that exercise as well, that is, both exercises will share the keyframe.

3) After 1 second of loading the page, make the green ball go from the left edge to the right edge and go back over 1 second per stretch. Use the keyframe created for exercise number 1 for that exercise as well, that is, both exercises will share the keyframe.

4) Make the green ball go from the left edge to the right edge while the mouse is over it. The duration of the event must be 5 seconds.

5) Make the green ball go from the left edge to the right edge while the mouse is inside the <section> element of the exercise. The duration of the event must be 5 seconds.

6) Make the green ball go from right to left while the mouse is inside the <div id = "exercise-6-square"> element. The duration of the event must be 5 seconds.

7) Make the blue square increase the width to the size of the exercise box and return to the original size infinite times with a time of 10 seconds.

8) Change the color of the red square to yellow in a time of 4 seconds in duration.

9) Change the color of the red square to yellow, blue and green in a time of 4 seconds of duration for infinite times. Change the colors in reverse order as well.

10) Combine animations number 7 and number 9 in the red square.

11) In this exercise, you have 5 squares (red, blue, green, yellow and black). They should all move from the left edge to the right over 3 seconds. This animation should start after 2 seconds of loading the page and should last forever. You must change the speed of the squares according to the following rule:

12) The red square must have a linear (constant) speed;
The blue square should start moving slowly, then accelerate and end slowly;
The green square should start moving slowly;
The yellow square should end the movement slowly;
The black square should start and end the movement slowly;
When clicked (and the click is held down) make the black square disappear over 1 second. After disappearing completely, it should not reappear.
